we are really committed to one affordable housing which we keep saying we are and if we are really committed to farming and growing our food and supporting local businesses these are all very small businesses were trying to support we keep saying
id suggest is looking at putting those needed commercial kitchens into our community centers because we already have a location we already have the structure and already have some degree of kitchen thank you
like to know who dont run around cow pastures picking up cow pies to use for fertilizer you go to places where there are a lot of livestock feeders or cows and you get a lot of noone time in order to use it for
training that would be involved with that education for these people this is part of the five point plan for the farmers union in my mind to bring apart this new change in our agricultural system and how we eat our food how what we eat and how we eat its so i would be completely
lay and be able to take that fourth and id like to see further that there are supports after this mentorship program so that we can continue to support those young farmers until they get to a point where they can actually begin to pay
concerns because there are several concerns about invasiveness about crosspollination and some other things like that so we need to get together and open up the discussion talk about those things as well as the benefits tider who wants to grab the goo is actually doing a survey right now to find out
weve done a lot of agricultural demonstration by phil crop demonstration over the last five years ive become very immersed in how to get those kinds of things funded at the state and federal level and i got expertise in a lot of the issues that have been talked about today so out
protect our water resources and again to reclaim the water thats here on the island to the people who really deserve it and not the large corporations who abused it thank you thank you
demand that we have that is real right now on our side we need to invest in our future and we need to invest in our farmers and farm education so that we can have people on
barriers that you would see that are kind of in the way now of getting something like this underway to have a new trip cycling center and what could you do to help kind of get those barriers out of the way
methods and methods that are better for us within them they are more apt to use them and i would want to create policies to make us use them he thank you very much we have one last
the housing and the egg and the growing food so i think its a good solution im really glad you were asking those questions thank you
i did fall down because i take the grass and i put it into my terilis mulch and how you fall off a lot more you were going to have to ask my wife about that i love the thought id like to know more about it
what we have control over and authority over and so thats my response to the state department of egg question on a pilot program years but what can we
until the people who sit on the council have experience in agriculture and listen to us thank you
land and other tax revenues jew do i have to go first on this
state we support agriculture to the tune of 04 no way and made a mistake this year they lowered it from 04 to 038 and the same breath they are saying food
at gregate product coming in and we need to help our farmers think about their growing a product because when we look at it everything is value added its not a tomato its all sorts of sauce you know these are the kinds of ways that we need
theyre not in use and its shameful its disgraceful when so many people need it that we hear so often about the need of all the different parts of our community that no one entity should be able
educate us as county council and as leaders throughout the state about the importance of that thing you thank you very much all of you thank you i dont know if we mentioned this this race actually has four people running but
this is for each of dana leake and handles so each of you have one minute address the same question you got a separate question thank you state department of bags so again were running forward
all green we need to grow a new generation of farmers equipped with the skills to create successful farming enterprises the holy farmers union united mayo chapters farmer mom
want to grow food because sometimes they are i think we need advocates for farmers and i think the county should create that whether its in the form of a grant writer or an a in the form of an a department or but some way to support the
have created thousands and thousands and thousands of tons of good soul amendment class eight approved for use and food and fruits and vegetables and that
at forty years old getting into farming didnt know what i was doing i was a gardener you know but i had the passion and thats what i still have today and thats what can sustain our family farm along with my wifes passion and our son who works full time on the farm and am
as land is tourism and we need to look at other opportunities of economic development i strongly believe that answer will come to us in the form of food production but to get food production and agriculture up
that they would come out and check the farm plant and you were following the farm plan you would get discounted rate and theyre actually doing that somewhat not but i discount it a little more where we make up them
arming a more successful enterprise and what will you do about that if elected go back to the future or so with that we must learn from our past
currently employed practices we dont support and i would say that dont work in one minute and starting with dracoffman what would you do to empower the whole via department
make that work wed love to change our garbage into energy into something useful but at what scale were you going to do it and are you going to make it economically viable and bestscaled at listening thats what
so i think me to be a part in a partner in this with the state moving forward thank you
during the three years itll rule whereas the water going to go it is a public trust so it would be reasonable to suppose some of that would go back in the ocean for the environment some of it for people in the out
you thank you very much well done this hot potato is in your lap here so i served as the budget in finance here for two years in 2005 and 2000 and
want to monitor that and have an enforcement part of this as well to make sure its one thing as we absolutely want to support were course housing if you were working on the farm thats very important and we all have to have support and housing
much anymore and thats something that we need to start to support more in our schools to support our fund id like to see get a apprenticeship programs in corporate alternative farming practices
believe its my cultural background that helps me to understand those of different cultures and we need to be able to find common ground in order to move forward and i also understand that although we may disagree on one issue
third time bringing with me you know the first time i got some of my clients to come along including one who just had a knee replacement surgery the third time i think i had had my knee replacement surgery
healthy food financing initiative they you can find a healthyfoodaccessorg there is the access the food access portal which also details quite a few funding sources i believe that a food hub here not only came
allowed for both of you have one minute what will you do to initiate a citizens task force and request proposals for this for the state of the art treatment plants
that means is the access and availability of food for all regardless of whether or not you are economically advantage or disadvantage now male county itself given it we were cut off from supplies by the barge right now we do not have
even if you have advocates for something and a sea susan bradford here a completely different subject matter we want to preserve several properties in front of a beach and you have advocates that support that and so you
the proprietary comment b70 was a near disaster for farmers and ranchers that lease or own barge properties meaning these lands protected from ever being seen at their market value
the consumers mean tile meanwhile we have 20000 tons of food waste at the mayo county dump and it does could be a valuable indigenous composting material so allend what plans do you have won
more 15 more seconds thats a lot well thats my farm plan i dont want to starve and i want to get more of the paperwork that i have to turn in that proves it thank you
you know no im good one of the situations we have as our recycling program has really gone downhill what wed rather do is recycle from the site instead of trying to separate somewhere
a bunch of different ways because you are dealing with students who come from very diverse backgrounds or very diverse communities and so i cant just say one time and hope they all get it i have to say five times in different ways and hope you all get it it might
free and we produce last year we produce 21000 pounds of food for the community on 2000 square feet so unless we were that efficient to produce that much food
county council so little bit difficult for us to have the jurisdictional authority over that so i want to see that first unfor most obviously it would be a good idea because its a step in the right direction
sleeping already the old madison containers are located all over this island and farmland and thats where your wafers sleep and sleeping him next is where they sleep but i close my eyes and squint because i dont want to see stuff that i might have to tell
daughter who came out of it actually she designs and fabricate her own womens swim wheel line so here she grew up in a farm family knew about being an intrepour near and she went and got to go work for somebody else you know and design
spending public funds and thats what i would need in order to know fully push this forward and that would be like joyce said joe said where as council people we cannot function in an infant
issues and be involved in any kind of negotiations and any kind of a planning there is always a need for mediation because there are always conflicting views as council member michael would be to be there as that media to help be
blue as key in line have been used to dispose of personally filtered sewage water the county lost the lawsuit citing violations to the clean water act and faces potentially millions in fines and has spent 225 million a year
hello and so i learned a lot in the garden i learned a lot from farmers you know that are doing way more than i am but one of the things that i think is a county we should do is support people
and to be able to know what different ways to say i need to look at you as an individual and see where you come from i want to know where you come from where youre background so i know how best to present it to you so that you can get it so we can get on some
candidates sounds mayo can solve remember there are four candidates on the ballot were only seeing two tonight so keep that in mind very good job thank you very much because
the drug dealing their drugs their medicines what are you going to call these things and the words we used to describe things that can be helpful to maintaining the health of our pets theres a little dog over there if you got him on heartworn preventative its one of them
also having gotten grants from the county i know that they have a lot of requirements but i think when you were looking at a program like this you were looking at something new and something different so i think everyone could come with a different set of art
system that needs repair and or replacement how do you as a candidate see you needed infrastructure being put in while dealing with the multiple entities out there that wished to control the water should our repeat that
part of the assad on the resolutions committee for the democratic party last year or last convention two years ago and one of the big things that came up from kocha was that people children were being born with horrible birth defects you could deny
im not a farmer i raise chickens for fresh eggs but i do see the benefit in just that smallscale farming of sorts for myself and my family the benefits of eating something
speaking with right now so these are three of the four candidates for the country console seat a stacey you have your own question two minutes what are your ideas for changing eggs sonning that will allow for more options for far
thank you one minute question is about buying and eating locally if the price of local food is unattainable for the average resident how can the county partner with its farmers to ensure that they get what they need to make eight
fourth with good longterm policy changes now it deals with changing existing then we have to look at that thank you
so were going to switch to policy a little bit and were going to have a separate question for each of you we have specific questions with each of you in mind our topic is the farm land zoning an affordable land trust in other word
70 proposal that i would incorporate and have that moving forward and that was the funding of the two or three staffing position to go out and verify if these get
regulations if you will to allow for that because right now its kind of complicated you really cant just put up a year you still need to permit if you have a tiny house you need to put it on wheels i mean its kind of silly but i think that is a county a
through all these experiences i learned so much about the needs of farmers the needs of the land of the needs of businesses to actually survive in a very competitive and a world market again working with some of our flowers were not able to distribute overseas because of being out
in how we are department of agriculture funded pilot and nutrient cycling composting center on mail and what do you see and what do you see any and do you see any barriers that are currently in the way up
minute to treat that food to become compost for farmers while my immediate plan is to run for county councils so that i want to have to spend as much time moving the north and garbade
of that and i very much honor and respect the expertise of those people who are experts when i was on the state land use commission i did vote against a very controversial development on awful because
in korean learning that the system that worked all along was the best system for the place which makes perfect sense but weve been i think in a place where we
thank you well on the subject of eating food security and selfsufficiency dream it could you in one minute tell us if barges of food stopped coming to me from the mainland tomorrow how he would propose
infrastructure like all those things like like housing affordable housing we need to be able to prioritize and give funding to those places thank you so much
looking at the backs of the council people except for the chair sitting way up high above everybody else and i decided at one point in a very weak moment to try and do something about it
think everybody in this room agrees that what were talking about the subject matter is i think were all raising our hand and saying is this is good stuff that were talking about but from the context of what can we do as council members i think thats whats important
amount of money in an unlimited amount of requests so basically i would sit on even help you look at how you can tailor your presentation to make it palatable to the powers that be because
as her own business in that respect so theres a lot of benefits to our recognize yet represents a family farm the multiplier effect we like to call its so outside of workforce development we support agricultural land trust
council members have to do is say heres the pay im sorry youre not going to get a piece youre deserving you should have it women helping women im all for it but theres not enough to go how were going to do it and got 15 seconds
something that could work but i would start with the us day and sit down with them as to how they could provide funding so you guys can realize your dreams thank you thank you again one minute
our next area is farmland zoning and affordable land for us to begin with show our organization supports the concept of farmers living on the land they farm and lease through an agricultural land
but it exists and it works and i think we need to be able to one be educated on what works in different parts of the world to be able to bring what is the very best home to have we also need to be educated in what always work here
about cutting them off completely but i think there needs to be a weaning weaning of monies towards that for the marketing aspect of our industry to support the additional industries that we want to lift up thats my answer
so across the nation these are becoming solutions for centralized food processing distribution etc etc our farmers union chapter c this is a great opportunity for creating farm cooperatives and we also c
completed due to marketing aspects that happened in the 80s way before i got involved those are all heavy issues and later i would love to communicate with everybody to get more ideas to help me understand individual issues to help
some of the firefighters still look at me and say you should have done that because it affected your career but i did thank you
i know on a very small scale what farmers experience on a large scale aside from the having to make a living edit so im not doing it on that level im just trying to raise enough tomatoes for my grandson
market what we need to do and what i would like to do in hope is to support those small farmers those that are going to our farmers markets now and allow them the tech that they need the manpower the equipment weather
security thank you
education for me and you know one of my things that i might keep saying is you know id rule up in a time where things were different and going to the supermarket became a luxury and that if you had any status you go to the market you dont have to have your own chicken were reclaiming that thing
so what can we do well i got tired of going to the seventh floor of the county building to give testimony i got tired of looking at my clients sitting there
for developing these food homes for the idea of training apprenticeship programs bringing healthy food into our community and developing through the county of mewways that we can use and certify these are getting farms so that a food can be given
to get people thinking about the food that is ground here and i believe that with the food not only can we educate farmers but we can educate the public we can have agretto orism where we can have people going out and getting more in touch with their food because
initiating something within our own agricultural subdivision to do compost and spun thing that we have there were already generating i think tens of thousands of pounds of food out of that subdivision every year
i want to take part of that question and say as a veterinarian ideal with chemicals all day long the wonderful thing about many of the chemicals that i deal with
practices in the last two years of my degree i fused on the anthropology of agriculture and how different countries through what the world are now reverting back to their indigenous agriculture systems in brazen
how much the cost of irrigation would be to develop a new site and so as policymakers as government leaders we need to be able to protect those people who are producing food we need to be able to protect those
farmers vegetable farmers those who even farm grain to some extent now that hemp is being talked about as a huge crop to look at you know working in a diversified and inclusive
organization is put together a five point plan you will hear about that five point plan tonight in our questions and that five point plan basically deals with the whole system of agriculture what makes up the whole system of agriculture and as we see it
food waste well theres not in a pig farmers for the food we sold how we would do that im not sure but i would like to see a recycling program that includes food waste because thats nutrients that can go back into the soil in the land
ranchers threw out the state it started eating more sugarcane well sugarcane went belly up because of the economics the real amazing thing is that this plantation stayed alive for 3040 years longer than the plantations on the other
on mail and now we have 10 chapters across the islands and about 900 members so we are growing exponentially and were fortunate to know that we have not all
funds in other words you know get some county funds the state would throw in something and thered be some matching for federal funds would you make this a priority bill or appropriation that you would stand behind introduce
pay for imported amendments and implodes irrigation cost in other words a lot of expense if you were going to be a farmer what do you think it will take to make farming a more successful enterprise and what could you do about that if you were elected
agriculture is subsidized over this entire plant the larger the agricultural operation the more subsidy there is the small rancher and farmer
advance so if we would start out what do we start out with you tanger you want to just take a minute to introduce yourself to our audience at here and in our viewing public one minute
a selves and the people who call meo home who live here who grow here and i mean grow their families grow our food who lay their bonds to rest here because it is all of us it is not those investment
conversations and then we had to engage people to help us in the solution because it was a problem that we couldnt solve by ourselves and sometimes we had very differing opinions and so part of the thing that im most proud of is creating collaboration is that were there
i dont have a done frankly i dont have the idea of how to make that happen and again you know it comes down to engaging those who have the expertise in those respective fields whether its fraud
is only 04 not even or is it less now but not even a half of a person is invested in agriculture and in that earner of agriculture how much of that is
between us we have a total of five children under the roof and the wonderful thing about this family is that it includes blood of chinese hui and puerto riga
potentially seasoned council members how do you see working together with others that may not share your values or point of view in how to address our agricultural needs and eric leak go first one minute
specific properties whether or not they decide to build other other dwellings on it to how as themselves or their family or their workers i think that we very critically need to look at more
collective of members who protect the interests of our family farmers from any practice that contaminates commodifies or compromises their ability to farm and market their products
is disgusting and so its not about empowering them that already have a motive of power its about holding them accountable and responsible for not using that power for enforcing rules for us for our benefit and the benefit
corporation that runs and maintains that system because right now the challenges you know we have a big corporation who has used that water system for its very existence and sugar you none
current at the height i was growing probably 14000 pounds in 2011 of ample bananess and so im like many of you put my hand into the into the 30
empowered its just making them accountable they are not working within the parameters that are already there for just the basic supports for just the basic regulations and i think leads to happen first is to get them
really wanted to make the point that we need mail county on board to really support a positive image for the future of agriculture here not look for more way
1000 to be a farmer people will game the system ive got a 10000 going to sell you for your 10000 land so lets not spend a lot of time making it more complicated
i think ive learned so much in my little garden and you know and it inspires me i created a whole program just from a piece of calo that my son got visiting someones field he brought it back he dropped it in a pot because i didnt have time to grow eight
s and so the idea would be to get that food waste and im not sure how the process would work into the hands of the people who could use it my example edge pretty good though is the pig farmers who go around to the restaurants and pick up all the
invested interests in it owning it maybe its the state i mean maybe thats the best answer maybe its a third party aisle would like to investigate that more thank you very much
when we think we need to start looking at sites available land if the county has existing land that they could provide to work the state on the pile program if its not state land if the county k
with a farmer apprenticeship mentoring program i would like to see the benefit not only in growing a new base of farmers but also in sustaining and growing the farm land that we utilize to apprentice these farmers
harm people and the environment we would you be willing to support the biological applications if he is your wife and how you would support moving in this direction if no give you reason why im not im not
you of how challenging being a candidate is and i think one of the strength that i have is my background in education to be an effective teacher you need to be able to present the same information
i ask children thank you
then you know theyve cut the streams off so the life cycles there have completely changed and there are farmers along the way we need to if our commitment is to diversify agriculture were going to need to share that water
equipment or something like that so i think those kinds of grants shouldnt be too restrictive because you need to be able to be creative with new projects so i would support that because i think the need is here and its huge
and we want to highlight those and bring that to where we can have a supportive system in place so nutrient recycling our nutrients back on to the land to rejuvenate the soils that have been depleted by plantation agriculture over a long period of time
this you have two minutes so heres your question our organization supports the concepts of farmers living on the land they farm and leased through an agricultural land trust what
county management and the importance of having a county manager that would work together with the council because the council needs to be working with the administration on these initiatives not against
to make it profitable how are we going to grow any product on an economy of scale that will be profitable i dont know at this point we dont even know if there will be water in the central valley
im looking forward to the election
places that they are currently farming those places that are currently in ad and we need to put aside those funds and invest if security food sustainability is our goal like water
bulls and they might all be very very worthy right because you might have somebody whos trying to create a farm you might have somebody who are who has a farm whos trying to get a bigger farm you might have somebody with a big farm thats trying to invest in and infrastructure more
happen you want to go to a barter system we can all make that happen but if you really want food security the part of it that is most interesting to me is making sure we keep out
farmers but gardeners and foodies alike who value our mission and what where what were about in rejuvenating our lands and also at the same time advocating for our local food production so what weve done as n
fishermen up there selling for fresh fish youve got people growing and cooking with their own food and selling wonderful fresh food at the market so something like that i also think that are and one of the biggest things that
discussing holding on or if its doing above what performance it was presented with them you can get expanded funds as far as permanent funds thats why we have other funds that got dedicated funds and that was passed
agriculture and the wide department of health by supporting bills that monitor pastapart pesticide drift to protect our health and environment such as product testing so
overcame burning and just the absolute attitude with which many in that department and i may say even in the apartment of ed have towards the people bringing up very valid concerns
do i would deal with what they shared it is the funding is coming from the state department of agriculture and this is a project however my understanding i think it was targeted for something like a million dollars i think is too little
in comes so i think what joe said is very important you need to make sure that you have the performance of a project in this case for a fun you need to make sure that its performing and if it is performing then you can start
back into the program because i always want to see a pay it forward but remembering where they have come from because if we can build that base there and maintain that strong foundation then that is one of the first steps not just selfsustainability for food but food
thats so thats what i would be looking for how can we make sure that this gets through and i would need to have all the information possible in order to have an order to create a really good
dithalize the used system they give of 300000 for a farmer what if we have 10 united farmers and all of them got that application of 300000 as 3 million that they could utilize in the poor
hence were those farmers that agree and that the promise that this is what they are going to do is grow food you know that we allow them the conservation easements to help ease the burden of taxes on those
texas for least parmalade and real farm and ranch land absolutely look at where the visitor industry gets its funding from i would take from the visitor industry funding first
cooperatives are a five point plan as working with the statewide firm to school initiative for growing food for the day we school lunch program all three of you have one minute please describe benefits you can imagine
and that even as a farmer other than working with the land i was involved with pesticide issues with land use issues with definitely the water issues that took to keep that farm going and to try and rehabilitate that farm after years of discerrry through that
speed we need a lot of farmers from the farmer printed side growing we need the level of food production at that level to where we now have merits for a processing center and thats where the food
come up with something in partner with the state on some of these pilot projects if we see some success then now the county has more of a lead to stand on in supporting these things beyond a pilot project but again we need to stay within the context i
that i know exactly where it comes from and i know what its been fed and in its huge its beyond physical sustenance it connects us to our i know and so i very much support agriculture and supporting
and its so beautiful to see these kind of farms these beutic farms springing up all over the place so its important that we support our farmers first and foremost making a living at what they love to do and secondly to put a cross
said is that if food hubs you want to have a commercial kitchen you give me a bit affirmative on that need a commercial kitchen one of the things i like to give to people one on sitting up in front of you and
i and we need to find ways to make that happen and so i would support that i think the concern is that sometimes people will say that its workforce housing and build a mansion on their land so i think that we would
difference boy thats told because if you go out after probably the lowest tax rate which is a residential people you are not going to get elected so i dont know the answer to that part of the question
because because navigating through the system to get something actually funded that is new its not impossible to know because ive done it for years with recycling but it takes on awful lot
here with a degree in education and eventually started being a teacher had a high school prior to doing that i got into the private sector and had some experience in that sector of trying to survive and make a living and start
enough food to last us out that we definitely dont and furthermore those who are at a better economic advantage then others will end up getting that food theres no doubt about it you know supply drives and demand drives that
a clear is an apa here actually for food waste and for food for first people the second is animal food right the third is composting and then we go to any type of energy and then we go to
policies that have been in place forever and then reexamine if they truly suit us today and if they dont then we need to look at what our community really needs and funding i would be able to bring different
one of the barriers is definitely that many of our leaders are not maybe not privy to the background of all the different farming
more education in the program so that the farmers that we produce are going to be able to accept and be able to deal with some of the change in diversity in the market pan
for the citizens of mayo that would result from the mayo county facilitating in funding a food hub let me repeat that please describe the efforts you can imagine for the citizens of mayo that would result from mayo county
parts of our community together i think one of my strengths is being able to reach out to those who are the experts in their field i readily know that i am not an expert in our field and i am aware
as an advocate i have already had that experience of working with groups of people and i would bring that skill even as a freshman and not a rookie at working in groups of people thank you
incidents the one im most proud of is i went to school one day and a teacher handed me a box full of chemicals and she said can you take an eye said well the fire department doesnt allow us to take them in i looked at the bottle some looked like they had
well the first thing is theres going to be a farmer we could simplify it a lot if we would just take the definition of farmer and say its anybody who files a schedule have on their federal tax return people get bogged down a
somewhere to do any good with it in the old days when i was a young man garbage was dealt with by collecting it and the hog farmers would gladly take it and if you paid them to pick it
is acceptable and thats going to take a change to what you revert by statutes or change to our county charter but thats something as policymakers that is an hour power to do and i think need to be able to look at that
and what happened people grew their own food people worked on barter systems people were able to have their own food hubs in their communities where they were able to trade and barter their goods for the things they needed why do i think food hubs are important because of food hub for sustainable
in a field of potentially seasoned council members how do you see working together with others that may not share your values or point of view and how to address our agricultural needs first of all think its wonderful that there are
of things that we need here
claiming an egg in classification that they are doing in and if they are not then they are going to get they are going to get charged more the other part of it is where do we come up with the difference probably one of the top this one
there is a lot of cost if you want to farm what do you think it will take to make farming more successful enterprise and what could you do about it if you were elected i think it is going to take the corporation
we know there are people on council who dont have very good listening skills and theyre good people and i dont mean you know its fat that you see when that red thing comes up it means you minute is over i am my red green color blanc sorry
fivepoint plan and you the folks that are running for office they can get into office to support us in this respect because were poised to work with anyone who is willing to work with us so on that note id like to introduce our first
getting nutrients cycling underway and what can you do to help alleviate those barriers do you need me to repeat that theres a misprint here and i stumbled
but domestic violence doesnt happen in a vacuum its a lot of the community issues things like poverty homelessness housing all the different effects of you no living on an island community and the cost of living and all those kind
way of getting nutrients cycling underway and what can you do to help all of you at those barriers maybe start with dain please forgive me mike if you if you will please if you can repeat the question on
housing start developing more sustainable lands that these farmers are actually putting more interest into their land as they are developing the cost and the resources that they can be gained from that as were developing that we need to look i think we need to look at that
was the legislature approved alexander bottom to keep the water rights for the next 13 years thats a complete travesty that should have that should be immediately really looked at and changed so that were not its not under corporate control on believe all of that water did that infrastructure that what
economic efficiency with the hope that this would replace currently employed practices that the farmers union doesnt really support so knowing that we have a few questions for you starting with air
organic and regenerative practices for field practice and economic efficiencies and the idea is to replace currently employed practices that the union the farmers union does not support so well start with you this time
to make money off of it so your question would be this is for each of you and i guess well start with june this time because we did with hannah what would you propose for getting lower tax rates on
founding fathers of the united states farm plan was straight forward we intend to not starve to death so were going to make enough food to eat it is yellow my times up or is it a warning ive got too
every year you have to write up your farm plan how much money are you going to make for the next five years as a farmer and the answer as well who knows is it going to rain is it going to float what is it going to do and what are you going to do
as well as human health ban the environment so would you initiate and support a county pilot program such as a testing for poland and honey to monitor pesticide drift
parks and hour hour highways our department of parks and rec hour hour county managing director if we can be able to show through experience through through works that these alternative
work here so you have concluding remarks about your position on agriculture and doors are a question you we wanted to be asked and you want to answer my concluding remarks i like to eat
advocating advocating and working on developing that third thing is new treat recycling centers were developing and advocating for those in our regions the reason why we have so many chapters is because we want
waste that way and so i would be very active in looking at the policies that concern this thing you very much
what issues would you want to raise before making such a decision in committee dr kaufman thank you for such a specific question if you want a new generation im
on the office that we are all trying to serve and so with that i look forward to the conversation this evening thank you
agriculture and most importantly food and it is a critical point here on this land and with interest i have in the production of food thank you
happened for my family is this fresh eggs you know getting our organic eggs that cost goes great by getting locally grown eggs that are all different sizes and colors and when theres a huge difference so that wasnt as
contaminates commodifoe or compromises their ability to farm and market their products so truth in advertising thats what the farmers union stands for they are actively involved in approving the ethic
as a farm apprentice mentoring program fiamand its about to begin its third year with county funding so the question is and we are going to start with a legal this time if the farmers union would have come to the budget
one minute what i can say is that youve got to have food available if youre going to eat ive got a bunch of goats if you want some gold milk or some go meat i can make that
one of the things that would happen would if to happen is that our building permit processes broken we have to fix that we have zining we have lots of regulations on what type of housing is permitted and where is the wafer
third party are completely one of the thoughts that ive had is maybe it should be a separate entity that just doing the public trust maybe not necessarily a nonprofit but it could be a nonprofit but it could be a completely separate
and then they fit it to their pigs and then they sold their pigs they could make money on both ends of the transaction and it would work it doesnt work that way any more the economics of raising livestock that
we have multiple hotels here who do these huge catering jobs and have all this extra food and i actually know that because sometimes the food is about our shelter when its good but you know theres all this by a product you know being food
more options for formlocker dwellings including temporary structures such as the new trend of teni houses and
increasing food production capabilities for small farmers by paving the way for reducing farmer costs our highway farmers union mail chapters say this is an opportunity for creating
these other substances which are well known hormonal disruptors and possible carcinogens and might cause physical harm to both people and the environment so the question is about
is an important aspect of what we represent and the fourth thing is food hubs have aggregates places where we can as farmers bring all or produce and then have that aggregate out whether its fresh and
or real farming and ranching is happening and part to assuming you will be on the budget and finance committee where would you be looking to make up for what you subsidize
development sorry for the fall start on that and there are comment on that is that with the average age of farmers in hawaii at 60 we can all agree we need to grow a new generation of farmers equipped with the skills to create successful farming
because if you intend im selling that compost you have a big what of environmental red tape to cathroet but i think red tape specialists this this is from the horses
some got to be about but the farmers the entrepreneurs are doing what they need to do to be able to get by and get the job done thank you thats why my time is up well i think youve made your point you made a good
a workforce especially if they are involved in an apprenticeship program or if they are involved in more community jobs i think thats a very important thing to have in order and that changes through zoni
citizens in mayo county need to take the helm on that and start doing their own tests there are organizations the department of water supply theres other groups where you can swore your screens i think we need to find out especially if you are living next to an agricultural area where their spring were
thank you need the question repeated or can you remember from when we get it basically if this came with the budget committee would you support it and would you support it being a line item every year and what to know in order to make that decision
for the next three years it wasnt 13 years as was stated earlier for the next three years theres going to be water coming through my after that the supreme court will rule or maybe sometime
the issue doesnt define a person and i think too often we see leadership to data that we are allowing one issue to define people and as a wonderful community the community that has helped to raise me we cannot be a little
composting towards weve got to take a look at you know catchment water other ways of actually surviving on the land that people have done for years that wed have regulated ourselves out in and
community is to start getting on some big business to say what is your plan especially alexander bald how are you planning on developing this for us they have stated for use for individual farmland ones that is together then i think we can move forward as a group towards a project
pretty quickly i also wanted to say that you know that we have a big housing crisis here so this is a solution i think to several problems
finance committee at the council asking that our famed graham be permanent line item in the budget and order to demonstrate that the county has ongoing support for growing our next generation of farmers what issues would ye
we need an empty seat up food helps across the nation food hubs are becoming solutions for centralizing food processing and distribution increasing food production capabilities for small farmers by paving the wafer
ideas would you propose in moving in this direction so that it would be actualized in other words howcoun we make it so that people can lease farm lands and actually live on them if a wonderful question is interesting i think we are looking
farms how we do it where we do it where we get the water again are going to be the key issues and what we are going to grow thank you great dinner you want to jump on that you need any repeating there know you up thanks and im going to you
would you prioritize it as a bill or procreation that you would stand behind introduce and or vote for ease please describe benefits you can imagine for the citizens
manor i think we really can keep a lot of the waste down from certain industries by utilizing it in other industries and that all of that together you know we can kind of again in a pay it forward manner use them
conversations about how much money you have to make to be a farmer well theres no guarantee that when you take up the mantle of being a farmer that you are going to make any money at all and then if you do give it a number you must make ted
same question what would you propose for getting lower tax rates on agricultural lands or real farming and ranching is happening in part two to this question is that assuming you will be on
our next subject is food hubs our prefectory comment is across the nation good hubs are becoming solutions for centralizing food processing and distribution
a lot of new people trying to get into public service because i think that were a testament to the fact that were ready for something different and so i think thats wonderful i also think that for most
worker dwellings including temporary structures such as the new trend of teni houses in you i think thats an excellent idea a low tidal house idea and i think that we do need to change some of our work
where are not there how are you going to move your garbage around is it going to have steep bonds in it is it going to have napkins in it how are you going to process it and handle it and make it make sense id sure
farm cooperatives further y farmers union 50 program is working with the statewide farm to school initiative for growing food for the doe school lunch program
project here was to build a compost but i didnt do that alone i had a team of people i had tim gunter from this community standing right there with me saying yes there is a market for this stuff we need to
so we can in the use of injection wells that are harming the ocean environment well thats a great question because its already happening theres already a citizens task force in a story working on this i went to a day long workshop back and made it add
account farmers that did not include people who are actively farming and that was the wrong thing to do when we look at what we what we can do to support our farmers i think we need to look at a conservation ease
of county and state government to be able to put aside those funds you know in just touching on the other questions i think i believe in order for us to change what
i think what we need to do is provide those spaces where we can start to look at that using material that we have here to grow our own our own soil
talking with you or to your camera or is something very practical where in a world of limited resources theres only so much that can get done one of the most difficult things
the budget
was my opening act oh im very very happy to be here among the farmers i grew up in farm country in montenegro can you conclude because were at our one minute here and thats what the red means
farmers because you might be really great at growing food and regenerating the soil and doing all the work that needs to go into and maybe not so great at writing a grant you know anne repeat just came out which is a request for proposals
build our agricultural strength regionally we want to know when youre growing things its a lot different than youre growing in line where james is right now you know and so each region has its own issues and its own challenges at own benefits
you know looking at not everybodys paying their fair share sometimes on taxes some people are paying too much some people are not paying enough so to have an affordsman peace to make sure everybodys paying their fair share thats really important to me at the end of the week to low the pay for itself
stacey one minute again when its been proven that there are biological applications that can provide solutions to agricultural production issues what is your position on promoting these over practices
since it was first proposed the first time and we were able to get it voted down and the second time it looked like we had the votes figured out i didnt show up because i knew we had the votes figured out it got voted down and then i went down then
comments here in the spirit of being able to grow our food here locally so we started as an organization in actually in 2009 but really in 2000 and 10 march of 2000 and 10 we had our first meeting
we have to get back to looking at the old system you know we have great groups at the waterst partnerships we have to make sure that the water coming from the mountain is safe healthy and clean for our farmers to use i think we need to look at it as this topdown system
security so it doesnt feel very secure to me as a farmer to hear that and my family and i have been farming here since 1990 t
law joe blackbird i want to take you back in time just got promoted to the hazardous materials captain at the my fire department took an oath to protect life and environment but very lucky guts sent away to the top training in the nation
and thats whos here in the audience tonight gets the least subsidy and you are the ones using your suite equity and the dollars out of your pockets from your second or third jobs to support your agricultural app
farmers months purchased imported nutri farm amendments is an expense for farmers thats passed down to the consumer in the meantime we accept 20000 tons of food waste at the mail county dump that caught
each other to think we are defined by just one issue because where we are more complex than that and we are more so much better than that also and so i think ive already had experiences with there are people you know i dont agree with
diversity and pest control in soil maintenance which is a big issue that will be discussing in a little bit and especially i think a lot of people when they think about farm apprenticeships they think about manual labor so why thats why i like to see more training in
the landfill that is the heirchi now have been involved in recycling like for a long time guys and we have funded pig farms even just last year when i was not a
indigenous systems because we know what works we know what this i know is made for and we need to be able to consult those experts we need to value that information and education instead of ignoring it and putting it to this shift
you in case we didnt explain before we have a lovely time keeper and when you see the yellow you have 15 seconds left and the red means one minute we were there so our first questions on the workforce development we probably heard this a fee
floor initiative that everybody has taken to understand whats happening on this island and thats its a very odd thing its a parody thats happening were just really lucky to have the opportunity i am really stand for being a law cook
bose and you each have kind of a separate question here one minute question so the farmers union is a solutionbased actionoriented collective of members who protect the interests of our family farmers from any practice
what would you do to empower the highway department of agriculture in how we health department by supporting bills that monitor pesticide drift to protect our health and environment such as things like product testing so
we dont know better yet like were just learning about that that we could take all that food and turn it into wonderful rich shawl is it not a new concept by any means is a very old concept but weve gotten used to doing
organize our food security for such a catastrophe easy question absolutely not an easy question because you know to me and ive looked up the definition of food security what
for a state of the art treatment plants is
provide back to the program and to the community not only the food that we all like to eat but that workforce that will be knowledgeable will have hands in the edge in no matter where they are at and well know specifically
biological ways that will work then we need to look at that if there are proven ways then we need to use that instead because i know that there are ways that are were just not using because were not being sort of sold by dow chemical you know
may her thats an issue also if you were going to be living on the last and where is that water matter for your house and the infrastructure but at the same time we have to take a look at things like
context certainly the farmers who may not have that skill set so i would like to see more advocacy for people like the farmers who need that level because theres money out there we just need to know how to get it soaps
supports the concept of farmers living on the land they farm and the land they lease through an agricultural land trust what ideas would you propose in moving this direction so that it can be actualized that people can live on there
so im very excited about the vision im excited about this movement im excited to see what we can do together as a community
effective to work on creating laws that protect victims of domestic violence creating task forces and collaborations and that work together and bring people in from actually know sometimes on polarized positions so i think
i believe and i absolutely would on the budget committee look at that funding first
you would want a beginning farmer program to have an order to win your support absolutely absolutely in my thoughts in a farm a parenthesis program in any apprenticeship program is important of diversity in their training as a young farmer
it comes from county sources or not to help pull out that food harvest what we need and make it a community thing because if we all share we are in an island it is a kick of thing we can we can get through thank you
and i see this as somebody who worked for six years trying to get bifil production tax credit passed i made it up to the fifth year got it passed and get it signed by the governor this year we actually got it passed and signed so it does take a lot of work to get it takes a lie
want to have raised before making such a decision other words what would you want to know before making such a good decision so starting with the legal one minute i really would not have the issue because you know its its
really looking forward to these questions mal thank you so much im going to point out before i turn this over to might that we have four people running on your ballot we have two of them here tonight so thank you very much for being with us here
where in the budget my ward excuse me where in the budget would you look for other tax revenue to make up for lowering taxes for least real farm and ranch lent
process of becoming a government
to eat every morning so i am here mostly to learn to im glad to know that the white farmers union is relatively young and so im not too far behind but curve and im grateful to go
thats the issue here at hand today we are not in touch with our food we do not know where it comes from most of it is packaged and we do not know whats included in it and i think thats the crux of our getting ill we need to take that back for our own
so and they know they built it and theyve maintained it but theyve also read their investment many times over so now its time to share the water with everyone restores some of the streams that had
for you to wrap things up and you have one minute each to offer any concluding remarks about your positions on agriculture or if there is a question that you would have liked to answer but it didnt get asked you can it
farmers union are the people who want this to happen so youd have to put together the package make it make sense and then i would push it forward from my of the situation talked a long time ago about i always supported oregon
by ordinance and so this is something that would have a potential to get a dedicated permanent fun but that again youve got to go through steps to do that i know earlier miss king from south mei as a candidate talked about how long its for her to gage
all that stuff there is so much food just from the hotels and catering companies that could end up in composing that makes perfect sense to me a thing part of the problem and the barrier is that were similar
areas are the worst even the line it gets all the attention because of the loss rate but that that is turning into a citizens citizens task force and i would support that going forward we looked at various kinds of technologies and we ascertain that thats that
there was such a high level of that that was proving to be connected to pesticides and runoff and things like that so the party created a position saying that that need to stop that we need to be informed and that people need to know what
ill look around the room and i see numerous people who i have provided that mary services for over the years i decided to run for the county council because i have been involved with it for culture
moving this direction and you know what what would you propose so they can really happen well thank you c and theres actually already a movement to make that happen and my friend dale boyner has been working on that he was the former head of the costume
for 40 years as a veterinarian providing services for cattle horses sheep goats and all the small animals you can name as well as welldaw
state our peas are very complex and i dont know im a grant writer i know how complicated they can be so i feel like the county would do well to higher ground right or to help not just the farmers but in this
sometimes a lot more time than what you would think so again i go back to the data i go back to the business plan go back to all the details that people want to know if they were responsible for
suffolk to look at what the chemicals are in the area with that i have to say that i think a lot of it is up to the individual landowner im against pesticides you know in my and my career and i have a large stand as a farmer
get somebody who goes and champions it and then at the very end because of other things that are going on money available to be of limited fun or lack of availability of funds people change their mind and they compromise
composting with my grandfather since ive been three or four he always had a big bucket near the both house where we put the fish stuff we put all the stuff we carved up for the vegetables in the garden then he made sure that he would mix it with a little bit of grass for we cut the lawn and we put it back in
higher tax burden they are also impacting us the most we still need to look at trimming the additional monies that they use for marketing it instead let them go through the marketing on their own so its enough
times this evening but our farmers are aging and we all agree need to grow a new generation of farmers and they need to be equipped with the skills to be really successful at their farming enterprises so the farmers union
okawa would definitely support it all in favor of fourth and new generation of farmers and what i would need to know is all the data that my council people my colleagues
lest tonight and thank you for staying this long into our presentation were going to start off with a giving each of you a one minute chance to introduce yourself tell the voters a little bit about where youre im going to start with mercarni at the end
death at once they get it and that would be enforced in a way that we wouldnt have an quote on quotegentlemen estates they would be active farms and so we have a man in our organization whos actually a board member of our 5013 foundation tailborne hour has been
to regenerative farming practices when it comes to this type of new treat recycling center and i absolutely believe that if we have the supports in place and at a small scale we can just grab
of you peers and your your colleagues who have different mindsets and convincing them of the benefit of this type of thing ill give you an example just to give you an id
a pagueta trees but they are not bearing and i have a nice house so i dont know where i would fall in this category i think weve got to go back to what the planning department has been doing which is making you do farm plan
as a way to make sure that we have enough food for this program for the department of education to buy food for our farmers so our question to get down to the question im not reading the whole intro im im im
that i have this much better seated in verse in livestock things with those rather than things with roots whether you call it in you which is exactly what it is or whether you call it garbage youve got to move it around and put
kind of common ground you know my travels in different countries have also helped me to not just present that information to people here in hawaii but people from different countries and end
organic at park do you have any idea what became a loose and do you think we should continue to pursue this concept in the next county budget session well i do think that we need to continue to proceed maybe not with that particular piece of property
question and the statement and i think of the programs that we have in place programs that we grew up with like if and things like that i noticed as an adult i dont see as much participation when we wore a
supplies water to the plantation not counting your game and there was water by his everywhere i think we need to get control back about water systems so we can use it to get back to the streams to get back to our people who need it with that we need to deal with our water quality
was happening in their areas because it was so dramatic i would absolute support that too i think the least that we can expect is to know whats going on an hour especially near schools and there are homes near parks and if there are
and so theyre not able to get everything that they wanted to get the bottom line is theres a lot of navigating through the system based on what you just said youve got to navigate it through fact your question one minute
because we seem to have this or members of the council seem to have this idea that that industry needs to be funded above all else and while that does bring money into our economy we cannot eat from it we cant we need to eat from our agents
in different parties to communicate well and to come up with a viable solution to every problem because conflict is part of life and as were seeing in most election processes right now that this is where were bringing people together and trying to organize to develop the vision
six oh not only was i in the middle of it i was on the share that at the facilitate this type of discussion and so a joe touched on it a little bit when were looking at it we have to make sure the guys who are
every year and i think we have the capacity to start doing something their one of our challenges would be we have a property there thats supposed to be dedicated for the park we may go to the county council and ask them to consider waving the park instant
studying anthropology of agriculture and then its amazing in india we talk about water in india they have a water temple system and this is how they manage their water where the people who
i wanted this to share a few things but im going to not share as much as i wanted to share because we are starting late id like to get this thing going so we all get home at a decent hour this selection is very important
do with all these pieces of paper putting them in a filing cabinet and all the work ive done to create that what happens with it probably absolutely nothing it just sits there doing nothing my farm planting everybodys farm plan are
you won last question and this ones labeled other but its for all three of you and will give you one minute we have noticed that many of the candidates running this year are freshmen in a field of potentially seasoned council
i do it the universe you know weve got 300 students in the process we just graduated 50 and was another 100 right behind them so we dont have this big army of farmers ready to take on but were starting to prepare myself being in the private sector in business
of collective work it takes a lot of people coming forward and explaining why this is so important i think it can happen i think it needs a bigger voice and i think it needs an advocate from the county council at the state legislature i have a lot of experience
vacue we have to have the community support behind pushing this government into new ways of doing things new ways of doing a thinking thank you thank you
continue to support that in any way possible so thank you thank you all in your concluding remarks
my career as an advocate im working with people who often dont see eye to eye domestic violence was not a very popular conversation in the 80s when i first started doing this work so we brought this to the public we started having
thank you have two minutes and your question is completely different given what it costs for the average farmer to rent a house lease farmland pay for equipment pay for imported amendments and import irrigation costs et in other word
read down of costs what are the administrative costs how many people are being benefited how is it going to carry on we know its important but everybody who comes before the consul has their own story and their own tea
id like to support farmers that commit to growing have answer mediated purpose and indeed identifying parcels for them to do that we dont have
closing presence for us with this particular crop first offers us an opportunity to remediate the soul because we need to do that quickly before we can actually start growing viable food i believe that will feed ourselves
and they do have a history of working with that and so perhaps we can help people sense that there and have them come to as i mean it is very possible to have partnerships outside of the united states as we have in the past before
if there are proven biological applications whats your position on promoting the over you know our business as usual practices again i think it comes back to when you know better and i have to do betters
those children thank you
thank you all our next question its strangely enough on the same theme only its about nutrient cycling centers and soa health and regenerative agriculture so our league in comment currently many of our hoa
you stacey do you have any concluding remarks about your positions on agriculture or is there a question you wish you would have been asked and if so please ask it and respond in two minutes well i really am
