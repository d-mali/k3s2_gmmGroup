i wanted this to share a few things but im going to not share as much as i wanted to share because we are starting late id like to get this thing going so we all get home at a disin hour this selection is very important to you
say it we support agriculture to the tuna point four percent no way i made a mistake this year they lowered it from point four percent to point three eight percent and in the same breath theyre saying food
security so it doesnt feel very secure to me as a farmer to hear that in my family and i have been farming here since 1990
free and we produce last year we produce 21000 pounds of food for the community on 2000 square feet so unless we were that efficient to produce that much food
cummins here in the spirit of being able to grow our food here locally so we started as an organization in actually in 2009 but really in 2000 and 10 march of 2000 and 10 we had our first meeting
on my and now we have ten captors across the islands and about 900 members so we are growing exponentially and were fortunate to know that we have not only
farmers but gardeners and foodies alike who value our mission and what were about in rejuvenating our lands and also at the same time advocating for our local food production so what weve done as an
organization is put together a five point plan youll hear about that five point plan done eyehyn hour questions and that five point plan basically deals with the whole system of agriculture what makes up the whole system of agriculture and as we see it is
at forty years old getting into farming didnt know what i was doing i was a gardener you know but i had the passion and thats what i still have today and thats whats consistent our family farm along with my wifes passion and our son who works full time on the farm and our
daughter who came out of it actually she designed and fabricated her own womens swimwear line so here she grew up in a farm family knew about being an entrepreneur and she went and got to go work for somebody else you know and design
has her own business in that respect so theres a lot of benefits to our economy that represents a family farm the multiplayer effect we like to call it so outside of work work for development we support agricultural land trust we
get out once they get it and that would be enforced in a way that we wouldnt have any quoteunquote gentleman estates they would be active farms and so we have a man in our organization whos actually a board member of our 501 free foundation tailbone hour has been
advocating advocating and working on developing the third thing is new treat recycling centers were developing and advocating for those in our regions the reason why we have so many chapters is because we want to
build our agricultural strength regionally we want to know when youre growing things in ham its a lot different than youre growing in line where james is right now you know in so each region as its own issues and its own challenges and its own benefits
and we want to highlight those and bring that to where we can have a supportive system in place so no front receiving our nephrance back on to the land to rejuvenate the soils they have been depleted by plantation agriculture over a long period of time
is an important aspect of what we represent and the fourth thing is food hubs have aggregates places where we can as farmers bring all our produce and then have that aggregate out whether its fresh and
and its so beautiful to see these kind of farms these baldeku farms springing up all over the place so its important that we support our farmers first and foremost making a living at what theyd love to do and secondly to put across
high point plan and you the folks that are running for office they can get into a place to support us in this respect because were poised to work with anyone who is willing to work with us so on that note id like to introduce our first
but domestic violence doesnt happen in a vacuum its a lot of the community issues things like poverty homelessness housing all the different effects of a view no living on an island community and the cost of living and all those kinds
i know on a very small scale but pharmacy experienced on a large scale aside from having to make a living it so im not doing it on that level i am just trying to raise enough to my friends
to eat every morning so i am here mostly to learn to im glad and know that the white farmers union is relatively young and so im not too far behind the curve and im grateful to be
develop and sorry for the fall start on that and there are comment on that is that with the average age of farmers in hawaii if its 60 we can all agree we need to grow a new generation of farmers equipped with the skills to create successful farming
also having gotten grants from the comte i know that they have a lot of requirements but i think when you were looking at a program like this you were looking at something new and something different so i think everyone could come with a different set of
cools and they might all be very very worthy right because you might have somebody whos trying to create a farm you might have somebody who has a farm who was trying to get a bigger farm you might have somebody with a big farm thats trying to invest in and infrastructure more
equipment or something like that so i think those kinds of grants shouldnt be too restrictive because you need to be able to be creative with new projects so i would support that because i think the need is here and its huge
question in the statement and i think of the programs that we have in place programs that we grew up with like fifah and things like that i noticed as an adult i dont see as much participation when we were in
much anymore and thats something that we need to start to support more in our schools to support our fond id like to see the apprenticeship programs in corporate alternative farming practices
you would want a beginning farmer program to have in order to win your support absolutely absolutely in my thoughts in a farm of printisorship program in any apprenticeship program is importance of diversity in their training as a young farmer
diversity and past control in soil maintenance which is a bit issue they will be discussing in a little bit and especially i think a lot of people when they think about farm apprenticeships they think about manual labor so i thats why i would like to see more training in
more education in the program so that the farmers that we produce are going to be able to accept and be able to deal with some of the change in diversity in the market than
thank you all our next question is strangely and all on the same name only its about notrends sacring centers and soil health and regenerative agriculture so our lead in command currently many of our hawaii
farmers months per case imported nutron farm hey amendments is an expense for farmers thats passed down to the consumer in the meantime we accept 20000 tons of food waste at the millicounty dump that could
one of the barriers is definitively that many of our leaders are not maybe not privy to the background of all the different farming
practices in the last two years of my degree faith have used on the anthropology of agriculture and how different countries throughout the world are now reverting back to their indigenous agriculture systems in brazill
in korea and learning that the system that worked all along was the best system for the place which makes perfect sense but weve been i think in a place where we use
we have multiple huttles here who do these huge catering jobs and have all this extra food and i actually know that because sometimes the food ends about our shelter when its good but you know theres all this but product you know when youre prepping food
all that stuff theres so much food just from the hotels and catering companies that could end up in composting that makes perfect sense to me i think part of the problem and the barrier is that were similar
we dont know better yet like were just learning about that we could take all that food and turn it into wonderful rich soil is it not a new concept by any means is a very old concept but weve gotten used to doing
to kate us as kandy koussel and as leaders throughout the state about the importance of that thank you thank you very much all of you thank you i dont know if we mentioned this this race actually has four people running but we
we need an empty seat oak food helps across the nation food hubs are becoming solutions for centralizing food processing and distributionincreasing food production capabilities for small farmers by tating the way for
cooperatives r5 point plan is working with the state wide farm to skew all initiative for growing food for the diabetes jewel lunds program all three of you you have one menu please describe benefits you can imagine
for the citizens of may that would result from the melicanthi facilitating and funding a food hub let me repeat that please describe benefits you can imagine for the citizens of may that would result from my country
fishermen up there selling for fresh fish youve got people growing and cooking with their own food and and selling wonderful fresh food at the mark so something like that i also think that oh and one of the biggest things that
happen from my family is this fresh eggs you know getting our gen at eggs that cost goes great by getting locally grown eggs that are all different sizes and colors and when there is a huge difference so that was n
dication for me and you know one of my things diem i keep saying is you know i grew up in a time where things were different and going to the supermarket became a luxury and that if you had any status you go to the market you dont have to have your own chickens but were reclaiming that now and i think
and what happened people drew their own food people worked on barter systems people were able to have their own food hubs in their commodities where they were able to trade and barter their goods for the things they needed why do i think food hubs are important because a food hub for sustainable
training that would be involved with that vacation for these people this is part of the five point plan for the farmers union and my mind to bring apart this new change in our agricultural system and how we view our food how what we eat and how we eat so i would be completely
for developing these food hubs for the idea of training of apprenticeship programs bringing healthy food into our community and developing through the county of more ways that we can use and certify these are getting farms so that a food can be given
so were going to switch to policy a little bit and were going to have a separate question for each of you we have specific questions with each of you in mine our topic is the farm land zoning and affordable land trust in other words
this you have two minutes so here is your question our organization supports the concepts of farmers living on the land a farm and leads through an agricultural land trust what
ideas would you propose in molding in this direction so they would be actualized in other words how can we make it so that people can lease farmlands and actually live on them its a wonderful question its interesting thing is i think were looking at
housing start developing more sustainable lands that these farmers are actually putting more interest into their land as they are developing the costs and the resources that they can be gained from that is were developing that we need to look i think we need to look at that
community is to start getting on some big business to say what is your plan especially pollocks and her bailed how are you planning on developing this for as you they have stated for use for individual farm land once that is together then i think we can move forward as a group towards a project to
speaking with right now so these are three of the four candidates for the acountry council ceta stisse you have your own question two minutes what are your ideas for changing eggs donning that will all owe for more options for farm
worker dwellings including temporary structures such as the new trend of tinny houses in your i think thats an excellent idea i love the title house idea and i think that we do need to change some of our
regulations if you will to all offer that because right now its kind of complicated you really cant just put up a year you still need a permit if you have a teddy house you need to put it on wheels i mean its kind of silly but i think that as a cumty if
were really committed to one affordable housing which we keep saying we are and if we are really committed to farming and growing our food and supporting local businesses these are all very small businesses were trying to support we keep saying we
are we need to find ways to make that happen and so i would support that i think the concern is that sometimes people will say that its workforce housing and build a mansion on their land so i think that we would
want to monitor that and have an enforcement part of this as well to make sure its one thing yes we absolutely want to support workforce housing if youre working on the farm thats very important and we all have to have support and housing
you know looking at not everybodys paying their fare shares sometimes on taxes some people are paying too much some people are not paying enough so to have an enforcement piece to make sure everybodys paying their fare share thats really important to me i think we need to look at that and that that would actually pay for itself
pretty quickly i also wanted to say that you know that we have a big housing crisis here so this is a solution i think to several problems
the housing in the a and the growing food so i think its a good solutions im really glad youre asking those questions thank you
thank you have two minutes and your question is completely different given what it costs for the average farmer to rent a house lease farmland pay for equipment pay for imported amen mens and import irrigation costs echin other words
theres a lot of cost if you want to farm what do you think it will take to make farming more successful enterprise and what could you do about it if youre elected i think it is going to take the corporation
comte and state government to be able to put aside those funds you know is just touching on the other questions i think i believe in order for us to change what
hes acceptable and thats going to take a change to what you revered by statutes or change to our county charter but thats something as policymakers that is in our power to do and i think we need to be able to look at them
holises that have been in place forever and in reexamine if they truly suit us today and if they dont then we need to look at what our community really needs and funding i would be able to bring different
arts of our community together i think one of my strengths is being able to reach out to those who are the experts in their feel i readily know that i am not an expert in offfield and i am aware
of that and i very much honor and respect the expertise of those people who are experts when i was on the state land use commission i get vote against a very controversial development unawful because
how much the cost of irrigation would be to develop a new site and so as policy makers as government leaders we need to be able to protect those people who are producing food we need to be able to protect those
places that they are currently farming those places that are currently in aid and we need to put aside those funds and invest if security food sustainability is our goallike water
infrastructure like all those things like housing affordable housing we need to be able to preuritize and give funding to those places thank you so much
there at parry are completely one of the thoughts that ive had as maybe it should be a separate entity that just doing the public trust made not necessarily a nonprofit but it could be a nonprofit but it could be a completely separate
corporation that runs and maintains the system because right now the challenge is you know we have a big corporation who has used that water system for its very existence and cigar you know
so and they you know they dealt with it and theyve maintained it but theyve also read their investment many times over so now its time to share the wire with everyone restore some of the stream news that have
then you know theyve cut the streams off so the life cycles there have completely changed and there are farmers along the way we need to have our commitment is to diversify our culture were going to need to share the water
invested interests in it owning it maybe its the stake i mean maybe thats the best answer maybe its a third party i would like to investigate that more thank you very much
system that needs repair and or replacement how do you as a candidate see the needed infrastructure being put in while dealing with the multiple entities out there that wish to control the water should i repeat that
was the legislature a proof alexander bottom to keep the water rights for the next 13 years thats a complete travesty that she have that should be immediately really looked at and changed so that were not its not under corporate control i believe all of that water and that infrastructure that was built
supply water to the plantation not counting your game and there was water by his every where i think we need to get control back of our water system so we can use it to get back to the streams to get back to the people who need it with that we need to deal with our water quality
we have to get back to looking at the old system you know we have great groups at the watershapet partnerships we have to make sure that the water coming from the mountain is safe healthy and clean for our farmers to use i think we need to look at it as this topdown system
protect our water resources and again to reclaim the wire thats here on the island to the people who really deserve it and not the large corporations who abused it thank you thank you
theyre not in use and its shameful its disgraceful when so many people need it that we hear so often about the need of all the different parts of our community that no one in it should be able to
worse that way and so i would be very active in looking at the policies that concern this thank you very much
economic efficiency with the hope that this would replace currently employ practices that the farmers nunean doesnt really support so knowing that we have a few questions for you starting with erid
what would you due to empower the hoé a department of ibraculture in hoé a health department by supporting deals that monitor pesticide drift to protect our health and environment such as things like product testing soil
citizens in my county need to tick the helm on that and start doing their own tests there are organizations the department of water subplates theres other groups where you can swab your screens i think we need to find out especially if youre living next to an agricultural area where there is spring or you
suspect to look at what the chimicholes are in the area with that i have to say that i think a lot of it is up to the individual and owner im against past decides you know in my and my carer and i have a large stand as a farmer
to see one menued again when its been proven that there are biological applications that can provide solutions to agricultural production issues what is your position on promoting these over practices that
whose other substances which are well known hormonal disruptors and possible carcinogens and might cause physical harm to both people in the environment so the question is about
if there are proven biological applications whats your position on promoting the overyouknowourbusiness as usual practices again i think it comes back to when you know better and i have to do better so
part of the isad on the resolutions committee for the democratic party last year or last convention two years ago and one of the big things that came up from khoichai was that people children were being born with horrible birth defects you couldnt deny it
there was such a high level of that that was proving to be connected to pesticides and runoff and things like that and so the party created a position saying that that need to stop that we need to be informed and that people need to know what
was happening in their areas because it was so dramatic i would absolutely support the two i think the least that we can expect is to know whats going on in our especially near schools and there are homes near parks and if there are
biological ways that will work then we need to look at that if we if there are proven ways then we need to use that instead because i know that there are ways that are were just not using because were not being sort of sold by dowchimical you know
parks and our highways are department of parks and rec are our county managing director if we can be able to show through experience through through it works that these these alternate
methods and methods theyre better for us where then and they are more up to use them and i would want to create policies to make us use them thank you thank you very much we have one last
you won last question and this ones labeled other but its for all three of you and well give you one minute we have noticed that many of the candidates running this year are freshmen in a field of potentially seasoned council
authentially seasoned council members how do you see working together with others that may not share your values or point of view in how to address our agricultural needs and eric you can go first one minute
issues and be involved in any kind of negotiations and any kind of planning there is always a need for mediation because there are always conflicting views as councilmember maigol would be to be there as that mediator to help bring
in different parties to communicate well and to come up with a viable solution to every problem because conflict is part of life and as were seeing in most election processes right now that this is where were bringing people together and trying to organize to develop the vision
in a field of puttanchially seasoned council members how do you see working together with others that may not share your values or point of view on how to address taradric cultural needs first of all i think its wonderful but there are a
lot of new people trying to get into public service because i think that were a test aim and to the fact that were ready for something different and so i think thats wonderful i also think that for most of
mike kerrer as an advocate im working with people who often dont see eye to eye domestic violence was not a very vocal or conversation in the 80s when i first started doing this work so we brought this to the public we started having
conversations and then we had to engage people to help us in a solution because it was a problem that we couldnt solve by ourselves and sometimes we had very differing opinions and so part of the thing that im most proud of is creating colorbration is that were very
effective to work on creating laws that protect victims of domestic violence creating task forces and collaborations and that work together and bring people in from actually you know sometimes unpolarized positions so i think
as an advocate i have already had that experience of working with groups of people and i would bring its skill even as a freshman i am not a rookie of working in groups of people thank you
view of how challenging being a kendi dades and i think one of the strengths that i have is my background in education to be an effective teacher you need to be able to present the same information
a bunch of different ways because you are dealing with students who come from very diverse backgrounds are very diverse communities and so i cant just say one time and hope they all get it i have to say if five times in different ways and hope you all get it
and to be able to know what different ways to say i need to look at you as an individual and see where you come from i want to know where you come from where your background is so i know how best to present it to you so that you can get it so we can get on some
kind of come and ground you know my my triadles in different countries have also helped me to not just present that information to people here in hawaii but but people from different countries and i
believe its my cultural background that helps me to understand those of different cultures and we need to be able to find common ground in order to move forward and i also understand that although we may disagree on one issue
the issue doesnt define the person and i think too often we see leadership today that we are allowing one is who to define people and as a wonderful community the community that has helped to raise me we cannot be a little
each other to think we are defined by just one is who because where we are more complex than that and we are were so much better than that also and so i think ive already had experiences with there are people you know i dont agree with
sooting athropology of a agriculture and its amazing in india we talk about water in india they have a watertemple system and this is how they manage their water for the people who disagnate pallet
but it exists and it works and i think we need to be able to one be educated on what works in different parts of the world to be able to bring what is the very best home to have we also need to be educated in what all is work here
our indigenous systems because we know what works we know what this i know is made for and we need to be able to consult those experts we need to value that information and that education instead of figuring it and putting it to the sire
so im very excited about about the vision im excited about this moment im excited to see what we can do together as a community
and that even as a farmer other than working with the land i was involved with custom side issues with land use issues with the finnally the water issues that took to keep that farm going into try and rehabilitate that farm after years of disarray through that
through all these experiences i learn so much about the needs of farmers the needs of the land of the needs of businesses to actually survive in a very competitive and a world market again working with some of our flowers were not able to distribute overseas because of being out
competed due to marketing aspects that happened in the 80s way before i got involved those are all heavy issues and later i would love to communicate with everybody to get more ideas to help me understand individual issues to help
you stacey do you have any concluding remarks about your positions on agriculture or is there a question you wish you would have been asked and if so please ask it and respond in two menu 12 irelium
i think ive learned so much in my little garden and you know and it inspires me i create a whole progburn just from a piece of cow that my son got vising someones field he brought it back he dropped it in a pot because i didnt have time to grow it
hello and so i learned a lot in the garden i learned a lot from farmers you know that are doing way more than i am but one of the things that i think as a county we should do is support people who
want to grow food because sometimes they i think we needed vacates for farmers and i think the county should create that whether its in the form of a grant writer or an a in the form of an ag department or but some way to support them
farmers because you might be really great at growing food and regenerating the soil and doing all the work that needs to go into and made not so great at writing a grant you know and just came out which is a request for proposals to
say darpees are very complex and i dont know im a grantrutter i know how complicated they can be so i feel like the cutty would do well to higher ground right or to help not test the farmers but in this
context certainly the farmers who may not have that skill set so i would like to see more advocacy for people like the farmers who need that level because theres money out there we just need to know how to get it so
i look around the room and i see numerous people who i have provided that marry services for over the years i decided to run for the county council because i have been involved with agriculture
for 40 years as a veterinarian providing services for cattle horses sheep goats and all the small animals you can name as well as wildlife
im looking forward to the election
all agree we need to grow a new generation of farmers equipped with the skills to create successful farming enterprises the whole he farmers onion united may i chapter his farmer
what issues would you want to raise before making such a decision in committee to coffin thank you for such a specific question if you want a new generation of
every year you have to write up your farm plan how much money are you going to make for the next five years as a farmer and the answer is well who knows is it going to rain is it going to flood what is it going to do and what are you go
do with all these pieces of paper putting them in a felling cabinet and all the work ive done to create that what happens with it probably absolutely nothing it just sits theyre doing nothing my farm planting everybodys farm plan ore
honing fathers of the united states farm plan was straightforward we intend to not starve to death so were going to make enough food to ease yellow my times up where is it a warning ive got to
more 15 more seconds thats a lot well thats my farm why i dont want to starve and i want to get rid of the paperwork that i have to turn and that proves it thank you
with a farmer a princesseship mentoring program i would like to see the benefit not only in growing a new base of farmers but also in sustaining and growing the farm land that we utilize to apprentice these farmers
provide back to the program and to the community not only the food that we all like to eat but that workforce that will be knowledge evil will have hands in the edge of no matter where theyre at and well know specifically there
tips of things that we need here
lay and be able to take that forth and id like to see further that there are supports after this mentorship program so that we can continue to support those young farmers until they get to a point where they can actually begin to pay
back into the program because i always want to see a paid forward but remembering where theyve come from because if we can build it based there and maintain that strong foundation then that is one of the first steps not just selfsustained ability for food but food
security thank you
i think what we need to do is provide those spaces where we can start to look at that using material that we have here to grow our own our own soil
farmers vegetable farmers those who even farm grain to some extent now that hemp is being taught the bodice a huge crop to look at you know working in a diversified and inclusive
menor i think we really can keep a lot of the waste down from certain industries by utilizing it in other industries and that all of that together you know we can kind of again in a payitforward manner use them
that i have this much better seated inperson livestock things with those rather than things with roots whether you call it in your witches exactly what it is or whether you call it garbage youve got to move around and put it
somewhere to do any good with it in the old days when i was a young man garbage was dealt with by collecting it and the hard farmers would gladly take it and if you paid them to pick up
and then they fed it to their pigs and then they sold their pigs they could make money on both ends of the transaction and it would work it doesnt work that way anymore of the economics of raising let us stop that
way or not there how are you going to move your garbage around is it going to have steep bones and it is it going to have napkins in it how are you going to process it and handle it and make it make sense id sure
like to know you dont run around copastures sticking up copays to use for fertile usur you go to places where there are a lot of lavas docked thaters or coves and you get a lot of more one time in order to use it for
the consumers mean tile meanwhile we have 20000 tons of food waste at the mary county dump and it does could be a valuable indigenous composting material so all in what plans do you have one
minute to treat the food to become compost for farmers well my immediate plan is to run for county council so that i wont have to spend as much time moving the nor in garbage
make that work wed love to change our garbage into an energy it is something useful but at what scale are you going to do it and are you going to make it economically viable and bestskilled at listening thats why
we know there are people on council who dont have very good listening skills and they are good people and i dont mean you know is for the thank you you see whenever a think comes up it means your minute is over im my red green color blindsauri
to regenerative farming practices when it comes to this type of noparent recycling center and i absolutely believe that if we have the supports in place and at a small scale we can just grow
our next subject is food hubs our periphery communism across the nation good hubs are becoming solutions for centralizing food processing and distribution
necreasing food production capabilities for small farmers by pitting the way for reducing farmer costs are how far farmers money and may all chapters say this is an opportunity for creating
farm cooperatives further y farmers bunyan 5000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
would you prioritize it as a bill or procreation that you would stand behind in produce and or vote for if yes please describe benefits you can imagine for the citizens of
healthy food financing initiative that you can find a healthy food accessorg there is the access the food access portal which also details quite a few funding sources i believe that a food hub here not only can
i brigade product coming in and we need to help our farmers think about their growing a product because when we look at it everything is value added its not a tummy with salsa its a sauce you know these are the kinds of ways that we need
to get people thinking about the food that is grown here and i believe that with the food not only can we do kate farmers but we can we do kate the public we can have bugra tourism where we can have people going out and getting more in touch with their food because
thats the issue here at hand today we are not in touch with our foo we do not know where it comes from most of it is packaged and we do not know whats included in it and i think thats the crush of our getting ill and we need to take that back for our own
said is that if food hubs you want to have a commercial kitchen you give me a beta firmative on that i need a commercial kitchen one of the things id like to give to people one on sitting up in front of you and
fucking with you or to you camera or there is something very practical were in a world of limited resources theres only so much that can get done one of the most difficult things
council members have to do is say heres the pie im sorry youre not going to get a piece of it as herbing you should have it women helping women ive all fought but theres not enough to go how are we going to do it and got 15 seconds
id suggest is looking at putting those neat commercial kitchens into our community centers because we already have a location we already have the structure and already have some degree a kitchen thank you
a workforce especially if they are involved in an apprentice such a program or if they are involved in more community jobs i think thats a very important thing to have in order and that changes through zoning
a for imported a amendments and emplods irrigation cost and other words a lot of expense if you are going to be a farmer what do you think it will take to make farming a more successful enterprise and what could you do about that if you were elected
well the first thing is there is going to be a farmer we could simplify a lot if we would just take the definition of farmer and say is anybody who filed a skidoh have on their fetal tax return people get bogged down in
conversations about how much money you have to make to be a farmer well theres no guarantee that when you take up the mantle of being a farmer that youre going to make any money at all and then if you do give it a number you must make ten
1000 to be a farmer people will gain the system ive got a 10000 go im going to sell you for your 10000 land so lets not spend a lot of time making it more complicated
sleeping already the old maidens and containers are located all over this island in farmland and thats where your wafers sleep and sleeping him next is where they sleep but i close my eyes and squint because i dont want to see stuff that i might have to tell
somebody about but the farmers the entrepreneurs are doing what they need to do to be able to get by and get the job done thank you thats when my time is up well i think youve made your point youve made a good
the property commenced seventy was a neardiscessor for farmers and ranchers that leased or owned barred properties we need these lands protected from ever being seen at their market value
same question what would you propose for getting lower tax rates on agricultural lands where real farming and ranching is happening in part two to this question is that assuming you will be on
the bugget and find x committee where the bugget you would look at you would look for other taxdriven you make up for lower in taxes for at least real farm and ranch land im sorry thats somewhat
since it was first proposed the first time and we were able to get it void down and the second time it looked like we had the votes figured out i didnt show up because i knew we had the votes figured out it got voted down and then i went down the
third time bringing with me you know the first time i got some of my clients to come along including one who just had a knee replacement surgery the third time i think i had had my knee replacement surgery
a brick culture is subsidized over this entire plant the larger the agricultural operation the more subsidy there is the small rancher and farmer
and thats whos here in the audience on it gets the least subsidy and youre the ones using your suedequity and the dollars out of your pockets from your second or third jobs to support your agricultural habit
so what can we do well i got tired of going to the seventh floor of the county building to give testimony i got tired of looking at mike lee and sitting there
looking at the backs of the council people except for the chair sitting way up high above everybody else and i decided at one point in a very weak moment to try and do something about
until the people who sit on the council have experienced in a great culture and listen to us thank you
where in the budget more words excuse me where in the budget would you look for other tax revenue to make up for lowering taxes for least real farm in ranch land
become farmers that did not include people who are actively farming and that was the wrong thing to do when we look at what we what we can do to support our farmers i think we need to look at it conservation ease
hence were those farmers that agree and that the promise that this is what they are going to do is grow food you know that we all love them the conservation easements to help peace the burden of taxes on those
specific properties whether or not they decide to build other other dwellings on it to how as themselves or their family or their workers i think that we very critically need to look at more
axis for least parmolat and real farm in ranch land absolutely look at where the visitor industry gets its funding from i would take from the visitor industry funding first
because we seem to have this or members of the council seem to have this idea that that industry needs to be funded above all else and while it does bring money into our economy we cannot eat from it we cant we need to eat from our edge nut and so
i believe and i absolutely would on the budget committee look at the funding first
thank you well on the subject of eating food security and selfsufficiency dream it could you in one minute tell us if barges of food stopped coming to my from the mainland tomorrow how you would propose to
or denies our food security for such a catastrophe easy question absolutely not an easy question because you know to me and ive looked up the definition of food security what
that means is the excess and availability of food for all regardless of whether or not you are economically advantage or disadvantage now malai county itself given if we were cut off from supplies by the barge right now we do not have
enough food to last us out that we we definitively dolden furthermore those who are at a better economic advantage than others will end up getting that food theres no doubt about it you know so please drive and demand drives that
market what we need to do and what i would like to do and hope is to support those small farmers those that are going to our farmers markets now and allow them the text that they need the manpower the equipment whether
it comes from county sources or not to help pull out that food harvest what we need and make it a community thing because if we all share we are we are in an island it is a kick of thing we can we can get through with thank you
thank you one minute question is about buying and eating locally if the price of local food is unattainable for the average resident how can the county partner with its farmers to ensure that they get what they need to make up
one minute what i can say is that youve got to have food available if youre going to eat ive got a bunch of goats if you want some gold enough or some gum meat i can make that
happen you want to go to a barter system we can all make that happen but if you really want food security the part of it that is most interesting to me is making sure we keep out the
ranchers throughout the state it started eating more severe cane well sever cane went belly up because of economics the real and amazing thing is that this plantation state alive for 30 40 years longer than the plantations on the other
collective of members who protect the interests of our family farmers from any practice that contaminates commodifies our compromises their ability to farm and market their products
currently employ practices we dont support and i would say that dont work in one menu and starting with your kaufman what would you do to empower the whole wide of cartman of
a brick culture in the white at parkment of hell by supporting bills that monitor pastapastside drift to protect our health an environment such as product testing soil
i want to take part of that question and say as a veteran aryan i deal with chemicals all day long the wonderful thing about many of the chemicals that i deal with
the drug dealing their drugs their medicines what are you going to call these things and the words we use to describe things that can be helpful to maintaining the health of our pets theres a little dog over there if you got him on heartworm preventative its one of the
and power its just making them accountable they are not working within the parameters that are already there for just the basic supports for just the basic regulations and i think what needs to happen first is to get them to
overcame burning and just the absolute attitude with which many in that department and i may say even in the apartment of it have towards the people bringing up very valid concerns
is disgusting and so its not about empowering them they already have a motive of power its about holding them accountable and responsible for not using that power and for enforcing rules for us for our benefit and the benefit of
our children thank you
to make it profitable how are we going to grow any product on an economy of scale that will be profitable i dont know at this point we dont even know if there will be water in the central valley
for the next three years it wasnt 13 years as was stated earlier for the next three years theres going to be water coming through me after that the supreme court will rule or may be sometime
during the three years itll rule where is the water going to go it is a public trust so it would be reasonable to suppose some of that would go back in the ascene for the environment some of it for people in the up
closing presence for us with this particular crop first offers us an opportunity to renety it the soil because we need to do that quickly before we can actually start growing viable food i believe that well feed ourselves
id do what to support farmers that commit to growing have answer meaded purpose and indeed identifying parcels for them to do that we dont have
and they do have a history of working with it and so perhaps we can help people sense that there and have them come to us i mean it is very possible to have partnerships outside of the united states as we have in the past before
workgears so you have concluding remarks about your position on a agriculture indoors or a question we wanted to be asked and you want to answer my concluding remarks i like to eat
im not a farmer i raise chickens for fresh eggs but i do see the benefit in just that smallskilled farming of sorts for myself and my family the benefits of eating something
that i know exactly where it comes from and i know what its been fed and then its huge its beyond physical sustenance it connects us to our i know and so i very much support a agriculture and supporting
ourselves and the people who call my home who live here who grow here and i mean grow their families grow our food who lay their bones to rest here because it is all of us is not those investments
continue to support that in any way possible so thank you thank you all in your concluding remark
theyd swing us we have a tughle of five children under the roof and the wonderful thing about this family is that it includes blood of chinas hauai in puerto rican
those children thank you
advance so if we would start out what do we start out with you tager you want to just take a minute to introduce yourself to our audience at here and in our viewing public one minute
for initiative that everybody has taken to understand whats happening on this island and thats a very odd thing its a paradigm thats happening and were just really looking to have the opportunity im really stand for being a local
weve done a lot of agricultural demonstration by a few crop demonstration over the last five years ive become very immersed in how to get those kinds of things funded at the state and federal level and i got expertise in a lot of the issues that have been talked about today so im
really looking forward to these questions mahalo thank you so much im going to point out before i turn this over to mike that we have four people running on your ballot we have two of them here tani so thank you very much for being with us here
in hoi aid apartment of agriculture funded pilot noetheran secling composting center on maai and what do you see and what do you see any and do you see any barriers that are currently in the way of
getting nutrients sickling underway and what can you do to help alleviate those barriers do you need me to repeat that there is a misprint ear and i stumble
county management and the importance of having a county manager that would work together with the council because the council needs to be working with the administration on these initiatives not against
kaposting with my grandfather since ive been free or for he always have bade buck at near the bow thus where we put the fish stuff we put all the stuff we card up for the vaguidables in the garden then he made sure that he would mix it with a little bit of grass for we cut the lawn and we put it back in
supports the concept of farmers living on the land they farm in the land they lease through an agricultural land trust what ideas would you propose in moving this direction so that it can be actualized that people can live on there
i do it the universe you know weve got 300 students in the process we just graduated 50 and was another 100 right behind them so we dont have this big army of farmers ready to take on but were starting to prepare myself being in a private sector in business
move in this direction and you know what would you propose so they can really happen well thank you see and theres actually already a movement to make that happen in my friend dale bohunter has been working on that he was the former head of the coastal
organic egg park do you have any idea what became a lose and do you think we should continue to pursue this concept in the next county budget session well i do think that we need to continue to perceive maybe not with that particular piece of property guy
and i see this as somebody who worked for six years trying to get by a dual production tax credit pass i made it up to the fifth year got it passed didnt get it signed by the governor this year we actually got it passed and sign so it does take a lot of work to get it takes a lot
collective work it takes a lot of people coming forward and explaining why this is so important i think it can happen i think it needs a bigger voice and i think it needs an advocate from the county council at the state lead gisletture i have a lot of experience
loisky and lyne have been used to dispose of personally filtered swedge water the country lost the loss of citing violations of the clean water act and faces potentially millions in fines and has spent 225 million on
all of them for both of you you all have one menued what will you due to initiate a citizens task force and request proposals for this for the state of the art treatment plans
for a state of the art treatment plants in
so we can end the use of injection wells that are harming the acine environment well thats a great question because its already happening theres already a citizens task force in a stair i working on this i went to a day long workshop back in may at the
areas are the worst even the lying that gets all the attention because of the lawsuit but that is turning into a citizens citizens task force and i would support that going forward we looked at various kinds of technologies and we ascertain that thats the
those had you each have kind of a separate question here one minute question so the farmers ani and is a solutionbased actionoriented collective of members who protect the interests of our family farmers from any practice
contaminates commodifies or compromises their ability to farm and market their product so truth and a purchasing thats what the farmers union stands where they are actively involved in approving the afficc
organic and regenerative practices for field practice and economic efficiencies and the idea is to replace currently employed practices that the union the farmers on ian does not support so well start with you this time
as well as human health and the environment so would you initiate and support a county pilot program such as a testing for poland and any to monitor best to side drift
arm people and the environment we would you be willing to support the biological applications if yes sure why and how you would support moving in this direction if no give you a reason why and not i am not in
concerns because there are several concerns about invasiveness about crosspollination and some other things like that so we need to get together and open up the discussion talk about those things as well as the benefits teacher who wants to grow the girl is actually doing a survey right now to find out who
for you to wrap things up and you have one minute each to offer any concluding remarks about your positions on a greek culture or if theres a question that you would have like to answer but it didnt get asked you can ask
candidate sounds meyau consul remember there are four candidates on the ballot were only seeing two tonite so keep that in mind very good job thank you very much because
lest tonight and thank you for staying this long into our presentation were going to start off with a giving each of you a onemanew chance to introduce yourself tell the voters a little bit about where you are and im going to start with mercarni at the end
here with a degree in education and even truly started being a teacher had a high school prior to doing that i got into the private sector and had some experience in that sector of trying to serve i have and make a living in start
current at the hate i was growing probably 14000 pounds in 2000 and 11 of ample bananas and so im like many of you put my hand into the end of the 30th end
on the office that we are all trying to serve and so with that i look forward to the conversation this evening thank you
a brick culture and most importantly food and it is a critical point here on this island and with interest i have in the production of food thank you
have created thousands and thousands and thousands of tons of good soil amendment class that have approved for use and food and fruits and digitables and that
was my opening act so im very very happy to be here among the farmers i grew up in farm contraion and muttonnet you can you conclude because were at our one minute here and thats what the red means
laudge of blackbird i want to take you back in time just got promoted to the hazardous materials captain at the my fire department took an oath to protect life and environment but very lucky got set away to the top training in the nation
he said the one im most proud of is i went to school one day and a teacher handed me a box full to mekels and she said can you take out an ice head well the fire department doesnt allow us to take them and i looked at the bottles some looked like they had
days some of the firefighters still look at me and say you should have done that because it affected your career but i did thank you
you in case we didnt explain before we have a lovely time keeper and when you see the yellow you of 15 seconds left and the red means one minute we were there so our first questions and the workforce development youve probably heard this a few
times this evening but our farmers are aging and we all agree we need to grow a new generation of farmers and they need to be equipped with the skills to be really successful at their farming enterprises so the farmers onion
as a farmer print us mentoring program vehement and its about to begin its third year with coutie funding so the question is and were going to start with a legal list time if the farmers on yen will have come to the budget
finance committee at the council asking that our fam graham be permanent line i am in the budget and in order to demonstrate that the comte has ongoing support for growing our next generation of farmers what is shows with you
want to have raised before making such a decision other words what would you want to know before making such a good decision so starting with the legal one minute i really would not have the issue because you know its its up
demand that we have that is real right now on our side we need to invest in our future and we need to invest in our farmers and farm big education so that we can have people on
is only poy for presid not even or is it less now but not even a half of a person is invested in a greek culture and in the arena of a greek culture how much of that is
thank you do you need the question repeated or can you remember from when we get it basically if this came with the budget committee would you support it and would you support it being a line i am every year and what would you need to know the order to make that decision
i would definitely support it im all in favor of forth and new generation of farmers and what i would need to know is all the day at my council people my colleagues
thats so thats what i would be looking for how can we make sure that this gets through and i would need to have all the information possible in order to have an order to create a really good
brick down of costs what are the administrative costs how many people are being benefited how is it going to carry on we know its important but everybody who comes before the console has their own story and their own tale
a amount of money and an unlimited amount of requests so basically i would sit on even help you look at how you can tailor your presentation to make it palatable to the powers that be because
hed come so i think what you said is very important you need to make sure that you have the performance of a project in this case for a fun you need to make sure that its performing and if it is performing then you can start
discussing holding on or if its doing above what performance it was presented with then you can get expanded funds as far as permanent funds thats why we have other funds that got dedicated funds and that was passed
by ordinance and so this is something that we have a potential to get a dedicated permanent fund but that again youve got to go through steps to do that i know earlier miss king from south maa as a candidate talked about how long its for her to get
project here was to build a compost but i didnt do that alone i had a team of people i had him gunner from this community standing right there with me saying yes there is a market for this stuff we need this
i did fall down because i take the grass and i put it into my tarot as mulch and how you fall off a lot more youre going to have to ask my wife about that but i love the thought id like to know more about it
initiating something within our own agricultural subdivision to do compost and spun thing that we have there were already generating i think tens of thousands of pounds of food out of that subdivision every year
every year and i think we have the capacity to start doing something there one of our challenges would be we have a property there thats supposed to be dedicated for the park we may go to the county council and ask them to consider waving the park instead
you know no im good one of the situations we have as our recycling program has really gone downhill what we rather rather do is recycle from the site instead of trying to separate somewhere
else and so the idea would be to get that food waste and im not sure how the process would work into the hands of the people who could use it my example edge pretty good though is the big farmers who go around to the restaurants and pick a poll at
food west well theres not in the pick farmers for the food we sow how we would do that im not sure but i would like to see a recycling program includes food west because thats no friends that can go back into the soil in the land
way of getting nutrients cycling underway and what can you do to help alleviate those barriers maybe start with dane please forgive me mike giffy if you will please if you can repeat the question
barriers that you would see that are kind of in the way now of getting something like this underway to have a norendscycling center and what could you do to help kind of get those barriers out of the way
this is for each of day no leak and handle so each of you have one minute address the same question you got to separate question thank you state department of bags so again were running further
county council so little bit difficult for us to have the jurisdictional authority over that so i want to see that first and foremost obviously it would be a good idea because its a step in the right direction
think everybody in this room agrees that what were talking about the subject matter is i think were all raising our hand and saying yes this is good stuff that were talking about but from the context of what can we do as council members i think thats whats important and so
when we think we need to start looking at sites available land if the county has existing land that they could provide to work with the state on the pilot program if its not state land if the county can
come up with something in partner with the state on some of these pilot projects if we see some success to it then now the county has more of a laid stand on and supporting these things beyond a pilot project but again we need to stay within the context of
what we have control over and authority over and so thats my response to the state department of ed question on a pilot program yes but what can we
do i would deal with what they shared it is the funding is coming from the state department of agricultural and this is a project however might understand i think it was targeted for something like a million dollars i think its too little
so i think we need to be a part in a partner in this with the state moving forward thank you
ok there is any pahairaakhi for food western for food for first people the second is animal food right the third is composting and then we go to any type of energy and then we go to
the land filled that is the hierarchy now i have been involved in recycling like for a long time guys and we have funded paid farms even just last year when i was not at
because if you intend im selling that compost you have a big one of environment or red tape to cathode it but i think red tape specialists this this is from the horse
so across the nation these are becoming solutions for centralized food processing distribution etc our farmers anian chapters see this is a great opportunity for creating farm cooperatives and we also see it
as a way to make sure that we have enough food for this program for the department of education to buy food for our farmers so our question to get down to the question im not reading the whole intro i am im
funds in other words you know get some county funds the state would throw in something and there be some matching for federal funds would you make this a priority bill or appropriation that you would stand behind and introduce
farmers union are the people who want this to happen so youd have to put together the package make it make sense and then i would push it forward from my end of the situation talk to long time ago about i always supported organic
farms how are we you at query do at query get the water again are going to be the key as soon as and what were going to grow then you great dain you want to jump on that you need any repeating their known ye oak thanks and im going to
of your peers and your your colleagues who have different mindsets and convincing them of the benefit of this type of thing ill give you an example just to give you an idea
even if you have it vacates for something and i see susan bradford here a completely different subject matter we want to preserve several properties in front of a beach and you have it vacates that support that and so you
get somebody who goes in champions it and then at the very end because of other things that are going on money available to be of limited fun or lack of availability of funds people change their mind and they can promise
and so they are not able to get everything that they wanted to get the bottom line is theres a lot of navigating through the system based on what you just said youve got to navigate it through thank you your question one minute
island is tourism and we need to look at other opportunities of economic development i strongly believe that answer will come to us in the form of food production but to get food production in a greek culture up to
speed we need a lot of farmers from the farmer printed side grown we need the level of food production at that level to where we now have mirits or are processing center and thats where the food
because because navigating through the system to get something actually funded that is new its not impossible i know because ive done it for years with resecling but it takes an awful lot
sometimes a lot more time than what you would think so again i go back to the data i go back to the business plan i go back to all of the details that people would want to know if they were responsible for
spending public funds and thats what i would need in order to you knowfully push this forward and it would be like joyce said joseph said whereas council people we cannot function an end
bycum we have to have the community support behind pushing this government into new ways of doing things new ways of doing of thinking thank you
our nextteriz farmland zoning and affordable land for us to begin with shall our organization supports the concept of farmers living on the land they farm and leased through an agricultural land
something that could work but i would start with the years day and sit down with them as to how they could provide funding so you guys can realize your dreams thank you thank you again one minute
more options for farm worker dwellings including temporary structures such as the new trend of tinny houses and
i dont have i dont frankly i dont have the idea of how to make that happened and again you know it comes down to inaging those who have the expertise and those respective fields whether its for
forced with good longterm policy changes now if it deals with caning existing then we have to look at the thank youd
arming a more successful enterprise and what will you do about the defilectin go back to the future of so that we must learn from our past
was allies the ustas system they give of 300000 for a farmer what if we have ten united farmers and all of them got that application of 300000 as 3 million dollars that they could utilize in the pool
one of the things that would happen would have to happen is that our building permit process is broken we have to fix that we have zoning we have lots of regulations on what tape of housing is permitted and where is the water
meter thats an issue also if youre going to be living on the last and where is that water meter for your house and the infrastructure but at the same time we have to take a look at things like
composting toilets weve got to take a look at you know catchment water other ways of actually serviting on the land that people have done for years that wed have regulated ourselves out in a net
process of becoming a government
really wanted to make the point that we need mayor county on board to really support the positive image for the future of agriculture here not look for more ways
to make money off of it so your question would be this is for each of you and i guess well start with joe this time because we did with hannah what would you propose for getting lower tax rates on
or real farming and wrenching is happening in part two as summing youll be on the budget and finance committee where would you be looking to make up for what you subsidize
mandon other taxriven use joe do i have to go first on this
i will can do trees but they are not bearing in i have a nice house so i dont know where i would fall in this cagory i think weve got to go back to what the planning department has been doing which is making you do farm plan
that they would come out and check the farm plant and if you were following the farm plan you would get discounted rate and they are actually doing that somewhat not but i discount a little more where you would make up the
difference boy thats true because if you go out after probably the lowest tax rate which is a residential people youre not going to get reelected so i dont know the answer to that part of the question
you thank you very much weld and this hot putted was in your lap here so i served as the budget in fine and sear for two years in 2005 and 2000
sixon not only was i in the middle of it i was on the share that at the facilitate this type of discussion and saw joe touched on it a little bit when were looking at it we have to make sure that the guys who are
plaming an egg in classification that they are doing and if they are not and they are going to get they are going to get charged more the other part of it is where do we come up with a difference probably one of the top this one
i or taxbird and they are also impacting us the most we still need to look at trimming the additional monies that they use for marketing it instead let them go through the marketing on their own so its not
about cutting them off completely but i think there needs to be a weaning weaning of monies towards that for the marketing aspect of our industry to support the additional industries that we want to lift up thats my answer
seventy proposal that i would incorporate and have that moving forward and that was the funding of the two or three staffing position to go out and verify if these guys
